## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

This application is built as a structured full-stack project utilizing the following technologies:

| Technology | Role | Key Feature Demonstrated |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **C# (.NET)** | Back-End Logic | Implementation of efficient mathematical algorithms. |
| **HTML / CSS** | Front-End/UI | Clear, responsive interface design for data input and output. |
| **ASP.NET MVC**| Architecture | Clear separation of concerns (Model, View, Controller). |
| **JavaScript** | Validation/UX | Minor client-side enhancements (if applicable). |

## ðŸŒŸ Features

The application offers immediate computation and display for two utilities:

* **Prime Checker:** Instantly determines whether any positive integer input is a prime number, using an optimized **square root check** algorithm.
* **Factorial Calculator:** Calculates the factorial ($n!$) of a given non-negative integer using a robust **iterative method**.
